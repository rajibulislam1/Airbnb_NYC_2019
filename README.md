Project Overview
Welcome to the Airbnb NYC 2019 Dataset Analysis project. This project delves into a comprehensive analysis of the Airbnb dataset for New York City in the year 2019. The primary objective is to extract valuable insights and discern essential behaviors of both hosts and customers.

Key Objectives
Data Exploration: We commence by importing pertinent Python libraries and loading the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame. The initial phase includes a meticulous examination of data types, meticulous identification of missing values, and a profound comprehension of the dataset's intrinsic structure.

Data Preprocessing: This critical stage encompasses the management of missing values, meticulous data cleansing, and the preservation of data integrity. We address columns with missing values and optimize data types to ensure data accuracy.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): EDA constitutes the heart of our analysis, designed to unveil latent patterns and intricate relationships concealed within the dataset. This segment encompasses an array of visualizations, statistical summaries, and a deep dive into the distribution of pivotal variables such as price, room type, and neighborhood group.

Hypothesis Testing: Rigorous hypothesis tests, including ANOVA, Shapiro-Wilk, Kruskal-Wallis, and others, are conducted to unravel the nuanced connections between variables. These statistical tests empower us to draw substantive conclusions from our findings.

Machine Learning: Leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, such as linear regression and random forest regression, we predict prices based on relevant features. The robustness of our models is evaluated through rigorous assessments, employing metrics such as mean squared error.

Project Goals
Our primary objectives in this undertaking are as follows:
